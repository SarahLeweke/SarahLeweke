- 👋 Hi, I’m @SarahLeweke and I'm a posdoc for mathematics at the university of siegen in the [geomathematics group](https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/geomathe/staff/orzlowski.html.en?lang=en).
- 👀 I’m interested in solving functional inverse problems over spherical geometries and handling severely ill-posed problems. 
- 🌱 We have currently developped an optimize-then-discretize approach for solving the inverse problem of reconstructing the human brain's activity from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroecephalography (EEG) measurements. For this purpose, the brain is modelled via a (spherical) multiple-shell modell and the electro-magnetic relations are described via the quasi-static Maxwell's euqations. We derived a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind as a mathematical formulation of the problem without additional smoothness or boundary assumption on the neuronal current. For solving this severely ill-posed problem with a minimum of discretization, we derived a vector spline method. With this method the minimization of the regularized Tikhonov-functional over infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces reduces to solving only a finite system of linear equations withou the loss of information. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on extension of this method for more realistic model assumptions.
- 📫 Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions to or suggestions for the project via leweke@mathematik.uni-siegen.de.
